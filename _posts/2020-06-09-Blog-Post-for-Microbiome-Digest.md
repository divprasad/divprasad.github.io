# Towards virtual physiological humans: integrating metabolism, physiology, and gut-microbiome

##### Precision Medicine
A milestone in precision medicine would be the ability to explore [generative models](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) that can capture the real-world complexity of human physiology. If computational models can successfully integrate physiology, metabolism, and host-microbiome data - thereby achieving personalization of predictive models of virtual physiological humans - this would be a key stepping-stone in yielding promising therapeutic targets that are both individual-specific and case-specific. Thus, the science (and art) of [generating and exploring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418305920) virtual physiological humans could be a boon to [systems physiology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059972/ "Grand Challenges in Systems Physiology") and [precision medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28273479/ "Systems Biology of Metabolism: A Driver for Developing Personalized and Precision Medicine").

##### Whole-body metabolic reconstructions
Towards this end, [Thiele et al.](https://www.thielelab.eu/ "Thiele Lab") recently published an [intriguing paper](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20198982). Thiele et al. demonstrate building and validation of sex-specific curated Whole-Body Metabolic (WBM) reconstructions. Computational models derived from such WBM reconstructions offer a novel molecular-level, anatomically and physiologically consistent, sex-specific genome-scale reconstructions of human physiology and metabolism. Thiele et al. further demonstrated that the WBM reconstructions can be 'personalized' via integration of quantitative physiological data with multi-omics such as metabolomics, and gut-microbiome. Thus, [Thiele et al.](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20198982 "Personalized whole‐body models integrate metabolism, physiology, and the gut microbiome") introduce [Harvey and Harvetta](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/1350ca22-22a0-40d8-ac99-600aceaa6df8/msb198982-fig-0002-m.jpg "Fig2: Organ compendium with sex‐specific metabolic reconstructions"), the male and female WBM reconstructions, respectively. These reconstructions and the derived models and analysis enable novel assessment of, e.g., host-microbiome co-metabolism that is individual-specific and is resolved at an organ-level.

##### Complexity
The extreme complexity of real-world metabolic modelling of host-microbiome in humans can hardly be overstated. [Thiele et al.](https://www.thielelab.eu/ "Thiele Lab") address this critical challenge via constraint-based reconstruction - their models account for the enormous diversity of microbiome-associated microbial genes that are meaningful both physiologically and is individual-specific such as in [host-microbiome co-metabolism](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/5214f63d-f5da-4dbd-8f89-15829c35f771/msb198982-fig-0006-m.jpg "Fig6: Application of the 149 personalized microbiome‐associated WBM models to predict host–microbiome co‐metabolism"). Thus this approach allows case-specific investigation of human metabolism, such as for studying inherited metabolic diseases.

##### Approach
Previously the [Thiele Lab](https://www.thielelab.eu/ "Thiele Lab") , extensive metabolic modelling of metabolic and physiologically relevant pathways (curated algorithmically and manually) led to a [comprehensive model](https://www.vmh.life/ "Virtual Metabolic Human") that allows investigation via [constraint-based reconstruction](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/ "The COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox") of over 80,000 pathways. [Thiele et al.](https://www.thielelab.eu/) [approached](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/b65485b7-23e7-487b-9f1a-f7d9c6191b41/msb198982-fig-0001-m.jpg "Fig1: Overview of the reconstruction approach and key features of the organ‐resolved, sex‐specific, curated WBM reconstructions") the problem into a smaller sub-problems that they have previously addressed. First - by compiling organ-specific information from previous literature and including experimental-omics data, Thiele Lab generated WBM reconstructions. Second - Thiele Lab imposed [constraints](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/db534045-630f-48e6-a0ec-a8b88774fbe3/msb198982-fig-0003-m.jpg "Fig3: Combining metabolism with physiology enabled physiologically constrained, stoichiometric modeling") the WBM reconstructions via (large-scale) physiology, dietary constraints and quantitative metabolomic data.

##### Highlights
A key challenge that Thiele et al. addressed in this current 2020 paper is the integration of more than 80,000 biochemical reactions, that were both anatomically and physiologically consistent. These WBM reconstructions describe 26 organs and 6 blood cell types and capture whole-body organ-resolved metabolism. Importantly, these recapitulate previously known inter-organ metabolic cycles and [energy use](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/92d5782c-76dc-4ea5-a8fa-fa93d4dbc79b/msb198982-fig-0005-m.jpg "Fig5: Application of the WBM models to predict basal metabolic rate (BMR)"). Interestingly, WBM models can also predict [biomarkers](https://www.embopress.org/cms/asset/5f051eb5-1eec-4c44-845f-b47f4250dd82/msb198982-fig-0004-m.jpg "Fig4: Assessment of the predictive potential of the WBM model"). This might, e.g., elucidate new pathways or targets that are implicated in heritable metabolic diseases.

##### Take-home-message and future ahead
Exploring such quantitative metabolic models could reveal new molecular insights pertaining to (co-dependence of host-microbiome) metabolism and overall human physiology and homeostasis – both in health and disease. The power of computational models is further exemplified if these allow addressing questions via novel hypothesis-testing that go beyond the scope of wet-lab experiments.
